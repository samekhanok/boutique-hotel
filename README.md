## [What is a boutique hotel?](https://hangarloftshotel.com/)

People who have to travel a lot and live in hotels sooner or later get bored with the monotonous interior of typical hotel rooms. It seems that they are stamped with a carbon paper, which is why charm and comfort are erased. It is much more pleasant to be located in the comfortable apartments of boutique hotels. Such institutions are the embodiment of creativity, luxury and exclusivity. They have their own style and are always unique.

The first boutique hotel was opened in the first decade of the 80s in London. The owner of the cult place was the designer, who decided to transform the dilapidated building and make it a hotel for art lovers. The institution gained such popularity that its analogues began to open around the world.
The advantages of boutique hotels

Individual style, exclusivity and excellent service are the key advantages of boutique hotels. Often they are opened in the buildings of former factories, museums, workshops, in aircraft hangars, on ships. This allows you to create a creative image. Guests are invited to live in well-furnished rooms, decorated in accordance with the style of the entire hotel. Guests can immerse themselves in the atmosphere of the gangster Chicago of the 20-30s or the cultural Paris of the early twentieth century.

The boutique hotel accepts at the same time no more than 15-50 guests, which also emphasizes the status of the institution. Externally, such places can be easily confused with a landmark or architectural monument. These hotels look spectacular, attractive and unusual. Special attention deserves the quality of service at the hotel. Each guest takes an individual approach. The staff does everything to satisfy even the most non-standard whims of guests. They are picked up from the airport on the Maybach, they have dinner at the best restaurants in the city, and VIP tables are reserved for them in nightclubs.

Perhaps the main advantage of the boutique hotel is its interior design. The best designers are involved in developing the concept of the future hotel. These already include Jan Schrader, Philippe Starck, Christian Lacroix, Calvin Klein. Many artists open their own institutions intended for stars of show business, pop and sports. Each room has a unique design.
What is the difference between a boutique hotel and ordinary hotels?

The difference between a boutique hotel and an ordinary hotel is primarily in bold design solutions, the implementation of innovative thoughts, sophistication and originality. In such an institution there will never be a large number of rooms, because the emphasis is not on mass, but on the quality of the offered services and living conditions. Accordingly, in such a hotel the prices are always higher. It justifies the originality and comfort of the hotel.

Another distinguishing feature of boutique hotels is the strict observance of the privacy policy. Guests can rest assured that all information inadvertently heard by staff will be carried to the grave. Because of this, such hotels are popular with celebrities and serious entrepreneurs who want to briefly hide from the cameras of journalists. The boutique hotel is an ideal option for those who want to gloriously relax in a secluded and relaxing atmosphere.

If in ordinary establishments the rooms actually copy each other, differing only in the level of equipment and furniture, then in boutique hotels each room is unique. Guests can always settle in new apartments and each time be amazed at their creative interior and design. Exclusivity is the key advantage and most important feature of any boutique hotel.
